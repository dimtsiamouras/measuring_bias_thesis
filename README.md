This Master Thesis Project investigates the Drop in Accuracy caused when Transitioning from the prevalent Random Train/Test Split to the more Advanced LOSO/Chronological Splits. Three distinct pipelines have been implemented using either the Standard Random Split, the LOSO or the Chronological split.

The author thanks the following researchers for providing their ML implementation, greatly facilitating this research:
